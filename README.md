The characteristic function is the Fourier transform of a random variable distribution. One of the ways to define the distribution law is to define a characteristic function. In many probabilistic models, only the characteristic functions are available to us, and not the densities themselves, which complicates the modeling process and the evaluation of numerical characteristics. The reconstruction of the distribution function or density of a random variable by its characteristic function by analytical methods is often an extremely difficult task, therefore it is necessary to resort to the use of numerical methods.
